# Organ Donation

## Diagnosis

* Organ donation should be considered as a usual part of 'end-of-life care' planning
* Identify all patients who are potentially suitable donors as early as possible
   
## Investigation

* Identification should be based on:
	* Absence of one or more cranial nerve reflexes and
	* Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 4 or less that is not explained by sedation

## Management

* Healthcare team caring for the patient should initiate discussions about potential organ donation with the specialist nurse for organ donation at the time the above criteria are met
* Where  patient has capacity, obtain their views on, and consent to, organ donation
* Where patient lacks capacity to make decisions about end-of life-care, establish whether taking steps, before death, to facilitate organ donation would be in the best interests of the patient
* Provided that delay is in the patient's overall best interests, life-sustaining treatments should not be withdrawn or limited until the patient's wishes around organ donation have been explored
* Consider:
	* Advanced directives
	* Patients belief, values
	* Whether patient registered and recorded consent on the NHS organ donor register
	* Explore with family friends whether patient expressed views about organ donation
	* Views of patients family and friends
* If consent not already gained: consent for organ donation should be sought from those in a qualifying relationship with the patient
  
### Approach to those Close to the Patient

* MDT:
	* Medical and nursing staff involved in care of the patient, led by an identifiable consultant
	* Specialist nurse for organ donation
	* Local faith representative
  
### Before approaching:

* Identify patient's potential for donation in consultation with the specialist nurse for organ donation
* Check NHS organ donor register and advance statements, Lasting Power of Attorney
* Clarify coronial, legal and safeguarding issues
* Knowledge of the clinical history of the patient who is a potential donor
* Identification of key family members
* Assessment of whether family support is required: faith representative, family liaison officer, bereavement service, trained interpreter, advocate
* Identification of other key family issues
* Identification of cultural and religious issues
* Approach Those Close to Patient in a setting suitable for private and compassionate discussion
* Should only take place when clearly established they understand death is inevitable or has occurred
	* Discuss with them that donation is a usual part of the end-of-life care
	* Open-ended questions 'how do you think your relative would feel about organ donation?'
	* Positive ways to describe organ donation
	* Avoid the use of apologetic or negative language
	* Assurance that primary focus is on the care and dignity of the patient
	* Explicit confirmation and reassurance that the standard of care received will be the same whether they consider giving consent for organ donation or not
	* Rationale behind the decision to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment and how the timing will be coordinated to support organ donation
	* Clear explanation of, and information on the process of organ donation
* Discuss withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment or neurological death before and at a different time from, discussing organ donation
