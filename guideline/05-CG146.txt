# Osteoporosis

## Diagnosis

* Consider assessment of fracture in women aged > 65, men > 75 OR under this age and following risk factors, but not routinely < 50 yrs:
	* Previous fragility fracture
	* Current use or frequent recent use of oral or systemic glucocorticoids or other causes of secondary osteoporosis
	* History of falls
	* Family history of hip fracture
	* Low BMI (less than 18.5 kg/m2)
	* Smoking
	* Alcohol > 14 units per week  women, > 21 units per week for men

## Investigation

### Risk Assessment:
* State absolute risk of fracture over 10 yrs using the following tools, within their age range and no Bone Mineral Density (BMD) available:
	* FRAX
	* QFracture
* Do not routinely measure BMD without prior assessment using FRAX or QFracture
* Measure BMD if assessment predicts at intervention threshold, or < 40 with a major fracture risk
* Recalculate fracture risk if near threshold a minimum 2 yrs elapsed or new risk factor
* Underestimation if: Gluco-cortoicosteroids > 7.5 mg daily, Excessive alcohol, previous vertebral fractures

## Management

* n/a
