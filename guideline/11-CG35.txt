# Parkinson’s Disease

## Diagnosis

* PD should be diagnosed clinically and based on the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria (discuss tissue donation for diagnostic confirmation)
* PD symptoms: Tremor (5 Hz); Rigidity; Bradykinesia; Loss postural reflexes (balance, gait disorder)
* Motor Problems:
	* End of dose effect, benefit wearing off earlier and earlier
	* ON-OFF effect unpredictable fluctuation
	* Dyskinesia (Athetoid or Choreiform)

## Investigation

* SPECT (single photon emission CT): where essential tremor cannot be distinguished from PD
* Other means of imaging should not be used: e.g. PET, MRI, MR volumetry etc
* DO NOT offer Levodopa challenge test
  
## Management

* DO NOT offer following for neuroprotection: Co-enzyme Q10, Vit E, DA agonist, MAO-B inhibitors
  
### Conservative
* Specialist Parkinson Nurse
* Physiotherapy: gait re-education
* Occupational Therapy: improve transferring and mobility
* SALT
  
### Pharmacological Therapy in Early PD

* The following are all first line, no universal first choice:
	* Levodopa (Sinemet - Incl decarboxylase inhibitor, reduces conversion to DA before BBB, as decarb can’t cross) Good symptom control, increased motor complications, low a dose possible to maintain function w/o motor effects
	* DA Agonist (Pramipexole - Non-Ergot derived preferred as Ergot derived Bromocriptine has fibrotic reaction S/E and monitor U+Es, ESR, Chest X-ray) Moderate symptom control, reduced motor complications
	* MAO-B inhibitor (Selegeline) Limited symptom control, reduced motor complications
* No evidence: Anti-cholinergics, Beta-Blockers & Amantadine, may help severe tremor in young pts
  
### Pharmacological Therapy in Later PD

* The following Adjuvant therapies are first line and offer moderate symptom control with reduced motor complications:
	* DA Agonist
	* MAO-B Inhibitor (Selegeline) inhibits DA breakdown synaptically
	* COMT Inhibitor (Entcarpone) Inhibits DA breakdown peripherally
* Modified release Levodopa should be used to reduce motor complications but not be first choice
* Anti-Parkinsonian drugs should not be withdrawn rapidly or allowed to fail due to poor absorption, or ‘drug holiday’ and may cause acute akinesia or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
* Given risk of sudden change, patient should be allowed to self-medicate during periods of transition
  
### Surgery

Bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation OR Bilateral globus pallidus interna (GPi) stim if:

* Have motor complications that are refractory to best medical treatment
* Biologically fit with no clinically significant active comorbidity
* Levodopa responsive
* No clinically significant active mental health problems, e.g. depression or dementia
  
### Non Motor Symptoms Treatment:
* Depression: low threshold
* Psychotic symptoms: Atypical antipsychotics only e.g. Clozapine
* Dementia: Further research required for Anti-Cholinesterase inhibitors
* Sleep disturbance: encourage good sleep hygiene, manage RLS
* Autonomic disturbance: treat urinary disturbance, ED, constipation, dysphagia
