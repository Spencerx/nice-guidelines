# Hyperglycaemia in Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)

## Diagnosis

* Recommendation for patients with Type 1 diabetes and ACS

## Investigation

n/a

## Management

* Manage hyperglycaemia in patients admitted to hospital for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) by keeping blood glucose levels below 11.0 mmol/litre while avoiding hypoglycaemia
* Consider a dose-adjusted insulin infusion with regular monitoring of blood glucose levels
* Do not routinely offer intensive insulin therapy (an intravenous infusion of insulin and glucose with or without potassium) to manage hyperglycaemia (blood glucose above 11.0 mmol/litre) in patients admitted to hospital for an ACS unless clinically indicated
* Offer all patients with hyperglycaemia without klnown diabetes: HbA1c, fasting blood glucose
* Offer: smoking cessation, weight management, diet, physical exercise advice
