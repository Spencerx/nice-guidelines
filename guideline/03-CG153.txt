# Psoriasis

## Diagnosis

* Patient with any type of psoriasis assess:
	* Severity at initial presentation to help evaluate efficacy of treatment:
		* Physician's Global Assessment: clear, nearly clear, mild, mod, severe or very severe
		* Patient’s Global Assessment: clear, nearly clear, mild, mod, severe or very severe
		* Body surface affected
		* Nail, scalp, palms, sole involvement
		* Systemic upset: malaise, fever common in unstable condition
	* Impact on physical, psychological and social wellbeing: use Dermatology Life Quality Index
	* Whether they have psoriatic arthritis: Psoriasis Epidemiological Screening Tool annually
	* Presence of comorbidities especially CVD see other NICE guidance, note psoriasis risk factor for VTE
* Refer to specialist: if diagnostic uncertainty; severe i.e. > 10% body surface; cannot be controlled; acute guttate psoriasis

## Investigation

* n/a

## Management

### First Line: Topical Therapy

* Account for patient preference: cream, lotion, ointment and review at 4 wks for tolerability
* Stress importance of continuation if effective and likelihood of relapse
* Before escalating treatment discuss difficulties with application
* Educate: continued potent steroid use leads to skin atrophy, striae and instability in psoriasis
* Aim for 4 week application very potent, 8 week potent and break of 4 weeks between applications

### Trunk and Limbs

* Potent steroid + Vitamin D analogue OD, separately for up to 4 weeks
* If Ineffective Vitamin D analogue only BD
* If ineffective: potent steroid BD for 4 wks OR coal tar preparation OD or BD
* Very potent in specialist setting only for max 4 weeks

### Scalp

* Potent corticosteroid OD for up to 4 weeks
* If ineffective: different formulation or topical treatment to remove scale
* If ineffective: combined Calcipotriol + Betamethasone OD for 4 weeks OR vitamin D analogue if cannot tolerate steroids
* If ineffective: very potent steroid BD for 2 weeks for adults only OR coal tar OD or BD

### Face, Flexors, Genitalia

* Mild or Moderate potency steroid OD or BD for 2 weeks, particularly vulnerable to skin atrophy
* In ineffective: Calcineurin inhibitor (Tacrolimus) BD for up to 4 weeks

### Second Line: Phototherapy
* Not to be used for maintenance
* Narrowband ultraviolet B 3 x week if extensive > 10% body surface or moderate Physician’s  assessment or topical therapy ineffective
* Ultraviolet A (PUVA) irradiation, but council that increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma
* Psoralen (oral or topical) with local ultraviolet A (PUVA) irradiation to treat palmoplantar pustulosis
* If poor response, relapse or poorly tolerated then consider systemic therapy

### Third Line: Systemic Therapy
* Offer systemic non-biological therapy if:
* cannot be controlled with topical therapy
* and has a significant impact on physical and extensive (> 10 % body surface)
* First Line: Methotrexate. Be aware that hepatotoxic, rise in AST, hence avoid in fibrosis/cirrhosis
* Second Line: Ciclosporin: Rapid disease control; have palmoplantar pustulosis; considering conception. Consider changing from methotrexate to ciclosporin (or vice-versa) if first-line inadequate
* Third line: Systemic biological therapy: if disease severe and not responded to standard treatment and anti-TNF being considered e.g. Adalimumab; Etancerpt; Infliximab; Ustekinumab
