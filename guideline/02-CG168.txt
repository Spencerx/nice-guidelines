## Diagnosis

* Explain likelihood of progression including complications: DVT, skin changes, ulcer, bleeding and thrombophlebitis
* Explain symptom relief, compression, interventional treatments

* If bleeding varicose veins refer immediately to vascular service

### Refer if:

* Symptomatic
* Lower limb changes: pigmentation, eczema
* Superficial vein thrombosis
* Venous leg ulcer (including if healed)

## Investigation
