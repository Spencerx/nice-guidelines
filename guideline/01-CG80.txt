## Management

### Surgery

* Treat patients with early invasive breast cancer, irrespective of age, with surgery and appropriate systemic therapy, rather than endocrine therapy alone, unless significant comorbidity precludes
* DCIS: breast conserving surgery for DCIS a minimum of 2 mm radial margin of excision, do not perform SLNB routinely in this case
* Pagets local: breast conserving surgery with removal of the nipple-areolar complex as an alternative to mastectomy
* Axilla: sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) / minimal surgery, vs lymph node clearance, to stage axilla if early invasive breast cancer and no evidence of lymph node involvement on USS
* Positive SLNB (macro or micrometastases): further axillary treatment
* Breast Reconstruction: discuss immediate breast reconstruction with all patients who are being
* advised to have a mastectomy

### Post- Operative Assessment

* Assess oestrogen receptor (ER) status of all invasive breast cancers
* Test human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) status of all invasive breast cancers
* Consider adjuvant therapy for all patients with early invasive breast cancer post surgery at MDT

### Chemotherapy

* Offer Chemotherapy agent Docetaxel to patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer as part of an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen
* Early invasive ER positive breast cancer who are not low risk Initial adjuvant offer Aromatase inhibitor (Anastrozole or Letrozole) if post menopausal or previously treated with tamoxifen
* Offer adjuvant ovarian ablation/suppression in addition to tamoxifen to premenopausal women with ER-positive early invasive breast cancer who decline chemotherapy

### Biologics

* Trastuzumab, at 3-week intervals for 1 year or until disease recurrence, as an adjuvant treatment to women with HER2-positive early invasive breast cancer following surgery

### Bone Loss

* Early invasive breast cancer should have baseline dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan if  starting adjuvant aromatase inhibitor treatment or have treatment-induced menopause

### Radiotherapy

* Early invasive breast cancer who have had breast conserving surgery with clear margins should have breast radiotherapy
* Offer adjuvant radiotherapy to patients with DCIS following adequate breast conserving surgery
* Offer adjuvant chest wall radiotherapy if mastectomy and are at a high risk of local recurrence
* Do not offer radiotherapy following mastectomy to patients with early invasive breast cancer who are at low risk of local recurrence (for example, most patients who are lymph node-negative

### Complications

* Lymphodema: inform and give advice regarding avoidance of arm trauma
* Arm Mobility: physio and functional exercises
* Discontinue HRT if diagnosed with breast cancer
