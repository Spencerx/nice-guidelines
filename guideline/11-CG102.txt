# Bacterial Meningitis

## Diagnosis

* Meningococcal disease = Bacterial Menigitis and Meningococcal Septicaemia
* Common non-specific signs especially children: Fever; N+V; Lethargy; Irritable; Ill appearance; Refusing food / drink; Headache; Muscle ache; Respiratory symptoms
* Specific Signs:

* EWS hourly if signs

## Investigation

* Unexplained fever and petechial rash:
	* Full blood count
	* C-reactive protein (CRP)
	* Coagulation screen
	* Blood culture
	* Whole-blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for N meningitides; negative doesn’t rule out
	* Blood glucose
	* Blood gas
* LP / CSF interpretation: primary investigation unless contraindicated, but don’t allow it to delay Abx
* CSF assay: WCC, Protein, Glucose and Microbiological culture, Gram stain, within 4 hrs
* LP contra-indications: Raised ICP, shock, coag abnormal, infection at site, respiratory insufficiency, use clinical assessment and not CT to determine is safe to LP, but if have CT and signs don’t do
* Delay LP until contra-indications resolve as worthwhile if diagnostic uncertainty
* ABx if CSF WCC > 20 cells/microliter in neonates, > 5 cells/microliter in children & adults
* If CSF within range consider alternate diagnosis especially Herpes simplex encephalitis
* If focal neurology or GCS < 9 then perform CT to look for alternate diagnoses
  
## Management

### Pre-hospital management

Primary health care professionals contact 999

* Suspected bacterial meningitis w/o non-blanch rash: tx to secondary care w/o parenteral Abx
* Suspected meningococcal disease: parenteral Abx i.e. Benzylpenicillin IM or IV, but don’t delay tx
* Withold Abx only in those with clear Hx of anaphylaxis, a rash is not a contra-indication
  
### Secondary care:
* Give Ceftriaxone immediately to young patient if: petechial rash spreads, become pruritic, signs of bacterial meningitis or meningococcal septicaemia or appears ill
* Give Ceftriaxone to young patient if: unexplained petechial rash and fever AND raised CRP / WCC
* If child has non spreading petechial rash, no fever, does not look ill unlikely meningococcal disease
* If no rash but suspected, and CRP / WCC raised and CSF abnormal then treat for bacterial meningitis, and if CSF not available
* If < 3mths give Cefotaxime + Amoxicillin
* If Herpes simplex encephalitis considered then treat with anti-viral
  
### Specific Bacterial Infection
* H influenzae Type B: Ceftriaxone 10 days IV
* S Pneumoniae Meningitis: Ceftraixone 14 days IV
* L Monocytogenes: Amoxicillin + Gentamicin IV
* Gram negative bacilli: Cefotaxime 21 days IV
* Unconfirmed Bacterial Meningitis: Ceftriaxone 10 days IV
* Confirmed Meningococcal disease: Ceftriaxone 7 days IV
  
### Treat metabolic disturbance
* Treat shock per CG84 and sepsis six bundle
  
### Cortico-steroids:
* If CSF frankly purulent, bacteria on gram stain, WCC > 1000, protein > 1 g/litre give Dexamethasone 0.15mg/kg (max 10 mg) QDS, avoid if tuberculosis in differential as may be harmful
* If meningococcal septicaemia then no more than 0.6 mg/kg/day

### Discharge:
* Consider their requirements for follow-up, taking into account potential sensory (hearing), neurological, psychosocial, orthopaedic, cutaneous and renal morbidities
* Test for complement deficiency if > 1 episode of meningococcal disease or any other serogroup than B
