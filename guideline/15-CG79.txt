# Rheumatoid Arthritis

## Diagnosis

* Recent onset: < 2 yrs
* Clinical diagnosis accepted over American Rheumatism Association guidelines 1987
* Refer urgently if any of the following apply:
	* Small joints of the hands or feet are affected
	* More than one joint is affected
	* Delay of 3 months or longer between onset of symptoms and seeking medical advice

## Investigation
* Rheumatoid factor blood test if  suspect RA and have synovitis on clinical examination
* Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) Ab if suspected RA and:
	* Negative for rheumatoid factor, and
	* Need to inform decision-making about starting combination therapy
* X-ray hands and feet early in people with persistent synovitis in these joints
* CRP measured regularly, and key components of disease activity (e.g. DAS28) to inform decision-making in:
	* Increasing treatment to control disease
	* Cautiously decreasing treatment when disease is controlled
  
## Management

### Conservative:
* MDT
	* Specialist nurse: access
	* Physiotherapist: improve fitness, encourage regular exercise, exercises for enhancing joint flexibility, muscle strength
	* Occupational therapist: with ADLs and hand function
	* Podiatrist: foot problems, offering functioning insoles and therapeutic footwear
	* Psychological: stress, coping skills
* Diet: no evidence for complimentary therapy but Mediterranean diet beneficial
  
### Pharmacological Therapy
* Newly diagnosed RA:
* First Line: combination DMARDs (Methotrexate + min 1 other DMARD + short-term glucocorticoids
* If disease control achieved, cautiously reduce dose
* If combination not appropriate: DMARD monotherapy, escalating to a clinically effective dose
* If introducing new drugs consider stopping / reducing existing drug once disease controlled
* Managing flares: short-term glucocorticoids with recent-onset or established disease

### Biologics
* Section 2: for Biologics technology appraisal
* Anakinra is not recommended not in combination with Anti-TNF
  
### Symptom Control:
* Analgesia
* Paracetamol regularly for pain relief in addition to core treatments
* NSAID (topical) for pain relief in addition to core treatments with knee or hand osteoarthritis
* NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor if non selective NSAID/Paracet ineffective, lowest dose shortest duration
* NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor: varying gastrointestinal, liver and cardio-renal toxicity
* If above analgesics not providing control, review DMARDs
  
### Surgery Referral
* Persistent pain due to joint damage or other identifiable soft tissue cause
* Worsening joint function
* Progressive deformity
* Persistent localised synovitis
* Imminent or actual tendon rupture
* Nerve compression (for example, carpal tunnel syndrome)
* Stress fracture.
