# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

## Diagnosis

* n/a

## Investigation

* Involve patient in HbA1c target setting, encourage maintenance unless impact QoL
* Target maybe above 48 mmol/mol, but inform any reduction towards target beneficial long term
* Measure HbA1c at 2–6-mth intervals, and 6 mthly when stable
* If pre-prandial well controlled but HbA1c high, self-monitor to detect hyperglycaemia
* If erythrocyte t/o abnormal use fructosamine to estimate (Not in T1DM)
* Self-monitoring plasma glucose: if on insulin, oral anti-diabetic therapy and hypoglycaemia, to assess impact of lifestyle and medication change, ensure safety while driving

## Management

### Conservative: Lifestyle / Non-pharmacological

* Diet: encourage high fibre low glycaemic index foods e.g. fruit, veg, wholegrains, pulses, low fat dairy and oily fish
* Integrate dietary advice with a personalised diabetes management plan
* If overweight, target wt loss of 5–10% may still be of benefit, greater loss long term will have advantageous metabolic impact

### Pharmacological Therapy: Oral Glucose Control

* Biguanide (Metformin):
	* If overweight & blood glucose not controlled by lifestyle & diet, consider if not overweight
	* Step up over weeks to minimise GI S/Es, consider extended absorption Metformin
	* Review if eGFR < 45, stop if < 30
	* If inadequate continue Metformin add another oral glucose lowering drug (Sulphonylurea)
* Insulin Secretogogue (Sulphonylurea):
	* First line if person not overweight or cannot tolerate Metformin
	* Second line if inadequate control, usually added to Metformin
	* If still inadequate continue Sulphonylurea add another oral glucose lowering drug
* Acarbose: if unable to tolerate other oral glucose lowering drug
	* DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin)
	* Instead of Sulfonylurea as second-line therapy to first-line metformin when control inadequate (HbA1c > 48) and significant risk / consequence of hypoglycaemic events
	* Second line to Sulphonylurea if Metformin not tolerated
	* Third line if HbA1c > 58
* Thiozolidinedione (Pioglitazone) NB avoid in heart failure
	* Instead of Sulfonylurea as second-line therapy to first-line metformin when control inadequate (HbA1c > 48) and significant risk / consequence of hypoglycaemic events
	* Second line to Sulphonylurea if Metformin not tolerated
	* Third line if HbA1c > 58
	* Combine with insulin if on high dose insulin w/o adequate control
* GLP-1 Mimetic (Exanatide)
	* Third Line to Metformin, Sulphonylurea and BMI > 35, or insulin contra-indicated
* Insulin Therapy: bolus or pre-mix
	* Discuss benefits / risks if HbA1c > 58 mmol/mol, start if agrees
	* If markedly hyperglycaemic on dual therapy consider insulin vs third line OGL
	* Start with Metformin and Sulphonylurea, review Sulphonylurea if hypoglycaemia occurs
	* Begin with NPH at bed time or twice daily
	* Consider pre-mix if post prandial high or long acting if require carer
	* If hypoglycaemia switch from medium acting NPH to long acting (Glargine, Determir)
* Cardiovascular Management
	* Lifestyle advice if > 140/80 (130/80 if vascular pathology), and medication is not controlled
	* See Cardiovascular risk, Hypertension control CG127, and lipid modification CG181
	* Anti-thrombotics: Aspirin 75 mg if BP < 145/90 (or Clopidogrel if not tolerated)
* Management of Complications see T1DM Summary
