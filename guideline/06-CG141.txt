# Acute Upper GI Bleed

## Diagnosis

* Blatchford score before assessment, if 0 then early discharge* Rockall score after assessment

## Investigation* n/a
  
## Management

* Stop NSAIDS during acute phase* Maintain low dose aspirin once haemostasis achieved* Consider risk benefit of Clopidogrel with specialist input* Acid suppression therapy (H2 receptor antagonist or PPI) for acutely ill patients in critical care
  
### Massive bleed* Transfuse with blood, platelets and clotting factors per local protocol, base on full clinical picture* Platelet transfusion for patients actively bleeding and platelet count < 50 x 109 /l* FFP fibrinogen < 1 g/l or INR or APTT > 1.5 x normal* Pro-thrombin complex for those actively bleeding and on Warfarin* Endoscopy for all unstable patients after resus, and all patients with upper GI bleed within 24 hrs
  
### Non-variceal bleeding* Endoscopic therapy, repeat procedure if doubt over haemostasis:* Mechanical clips with or without adrenaline* Thermal coagulation with adrenaline* Fibrin or thrombin with adrenaline* Offer interventional radiology who re-bleed after endoscopy, or emergency surgery* PPI: only offer post endoscopy following evidence of recent haemorrhage
  
### Variceal bleed* Terlipressin at presentation until definitive haemostasis, consider prophylactic anti-biotics* Endoscopic band ligation should be offered
  
### Gastric varices* Endoscopic injection of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate Or TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) not successful
