# Hypertension in Adults

## Diagnosis

* Stage 1 > 140/95 (clinical setting); 135/85 (ABPM)
* Stage 2 > 160/100 (clinical); 150/85 (ABPM)
* Severe > 180/110
* If pulse irregularity measure manually
* If automated ensure calibrated and cuff size adequate
* If Stage 1 measure 3 x taking lower of latter readings in clinic, if confirmed offer ABPM (2 per hour)

## Investigation

* While waiting for confirmation of hypertension diagnosis look for evidence of end organ damage: LVF, CKD (albuminaemia or proteinaemia) and hypertensive retinopathy
* Assess cardiovascular risk score (e.g. Qrisk)
* For all patients with hypertension:
  * Urine: Albumin creatinine ratio
  * U+E, eGFR
  * Serum cholesterol and HDL
  * Examine Fundi
  * 12 lead ECG

## Management

* Lifestyle interventions: diet, exercise, alcohol patterns, smoking cessation and suggest but not offer relaxation therapies
* Discourage caffeine and salt intake
* If severe consider treating immediately with anti-hypertensives
* If severe and papilloedema then accelerated hence refer to specialised care same day
* If systolic falls > 20 mm Hg on standing review medication or refer for postural hypotension (+ headache, palpitations and pallor consider phaeochromocytoma (adrenal medullary tumour) and refer same day)

### Pharmacological offer oral anti-hypertensives:

* Stage 1 (< 80) and target organ damage, renal disease, diabetes or cardiovascular disease, with end target < 140/90 or 150/90 if > 80 yrs
* Stage 1, < 40 yrs and none of the above risk factors investigate secondary causes as risk underestimated
* Stage 2 at any age

### Step 1:

* < 55 yrs ACE or if not tolerated ARB
* > 55 or Afro-Caribbean offer CCB, if oedema not tolerated or HF risk then consider Thiazide diuretic
* Offer Thiazide type diuretic (Indapamide or Chlotalidone) in preference to Bendroflumethazide
* Only consider Beta Blocker if ACE/ARB not tolerated or woman child bearing age

### Step 2:

* If BP still not controlled offer CCB in combination with ACE / ARB (in black person ARB + CCB)

### Step 3:

* Diuretic + CCB + ACE / ARB

### Step 4:

* Consider Spironolactone (if K+ < 4.5) or increase Thiazide dose, monitoring electrolytes and creatinine
* Consider an Alpha Blocker or Beta Blocker
