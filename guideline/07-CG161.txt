# Falls Assessment

## Diagnosis

*  Risk identification: older person in contact with healthcare professional ask if fallen in past year, and observe for balance or gait deficit
* Conduct multifactorial falls risk assessment if present with fall, balance or gait deficit, considering:
	* Falls history
	* Gait, balance and mobility, and muscle weakness
	* Osteoporosis risk
	* Perceived functional ability and fear relating to falling
	* Visual impairment
	* Cognitive impairment and neurological examination
	* Urinary continence
	* Hazards at home
	* Cardio-vascular examination
* In hospital also consider:
	* Footwear that is unsuitable or missing
	* Syncope syndrome
  
## Investigation

* Regard the following groups of inpatients to be at risk in hospital:
	* All patients >65 years
	* Patients 50-64 years judged by clinician to be at higher risk due to underlying condition
* Do not use fall risk prediction tools to predict inpatients' risk of falling in hospital

## Management

* All older people with recurrent falls or assessed as being at increased risk of falling should be considered for an individualised multifactorial intervention, comprising:
	* Strength and balance training: muscle strengthening when appropriate
	* Home hazard assessment and intervention
	* Vision assessment and referral
	* Medication review with modification/withdrawal, especially psychotropic medications
* Cardiac pacing should be considered for cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity
* Discuss what changes patient willing to make, and address potential barriers
* Do not recommend brisk walking: may increase risk
* Little evidence for:
	* Low intensity exercise combined with incontinence programmes
	* Group exercise (untargeted)
	* Cognitive/behavioural interventions
	* Referral for correction of visual impairment
	* Vitamin D
	* Hip protectors
