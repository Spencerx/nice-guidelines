# CG126 Management of Stable Angina

## Diagnosis

* See CG95 for chest pain guidance

## Investigation

* n/a

## Management

* Short acting nitrate for prevention and treatment: advice on use before planned exertion, and to sit down or hold onto something if feel light headed. Side effects of flushing and headache
* Repeat dose after 5 mins if symptoms persist, call an ambulance if pain persist 5 mins after 2nd dose
* Secondary prevention of Cardiovascular disease:
	* Aspirin 75 mg taking into account bleeding risk
	* ACE inhibitor if co-morbid diabetes and stable angina
	* Statin for lipid lowering
	* Treat hypertension
* First line treatment: Either Beta Blocker or CCB, switching between if either not tolerated, or in combination if not effective (though note B Blocker and Verapamil hypotension risk)
* Other monotherapy treatment if above not tolerated, or still not controlled
	* Long acting nitrate
	* Ivabradine
	* Nicorandil
	* Ranolazine
* Only offer 3 drugs in combination if revascularisation not appropriate
* If stable disease discuss prognosis, risk benefit of CABG if have disease of 3 proximal vessels or left main stem, and should be offered if functional testing highlights these diseases
* If symptoms still not controlled satisfactorily with medical treatment consider by-pass grafting (CABG) or PCI, which ever is more appropriate, together with coronary angiography to guide treatment
* Take into account survival benefit of CABG over PCI in patients > 65 or have diabetes or have complex 3 vessel disease (with or without involvement of left main stem
* MDT (surgeons and interventionalists) should discuss patients with complex 3 vessel disease or doubt about best method
