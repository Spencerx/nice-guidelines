# CG147 Lower Limb Peripheral Artery Disease

## Diagnosis

* Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease advice and support
	* Smoking cessation
	* Diet weight management
	* Lipid modification
	* Prevention of diabetes
	* Prevention of high blood pressure
* Assess if patients have symptoms of peripheral artery disease; diabetes & non healing wounds on leg; need compression hosiery; considered for intervention in leg or foot
* Ask about symptoms including leg claudication, and critical limb ischaemia
* Assess femoral, popliteal and foot pulses
* If critical limb ischaemia ensure MDT review before treatment
  
## Investigation

* Measure ankle brachial pressure index: record systolic blood pressure with appropriately sized cuff in both arms and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries, taking measurements using a Doppler probe
* Calculate ABPI by dividing the highest ankle pressure over the highest arm pressure
* Duplex ultrasound as first line imaging
* Contrast enhanced CT if have PAD and need further imaging or CT angiography if contra-indicated

## Management

### Intermittent Claudication

* Conservative: 2 hr supervised exercise weekly for 3 mths, and encourage to exercise to  point of maximal pain
* Angioiplasty should be offered once advice on modifiable risk factors reinforced and for whom exercise therapy has not led to satisfactory improvement and imaging confirmed suitable
* Primary stent (bare metal) placement considered for complete aorto-iliac occlusion, but not femoro-popliteal disease
* By-pass grafting offered only where angioplasty unsuccessful in life limiting disease and imaging confirmed suitable, using an autologous vein where possible
* Naftidrofuryl oxalate may be offered if exercise not helped and angioplasty / surgery declined
  
### Critical Limb ischaemia

* Angioplasty or by-pass grafting taking into account co-morbidities, vein availability, patient preference, disease pattern
* Only offer primary stent placement in complete aorto-iliac occlusion, using bare metal stent
* Pain management: WHO ladder with laxatives and anti-emetics, and referral to pain management team if pain persists and not able to revascularise
* Amputation once all options to revascualrise have been exhausted
