# Chest Pain Recent Onset

## Diagnosis

* Refer to hospital for ACS protocol if 12 lead ECG abnormal OR chest pain per following:
  * Pain in chest (arms, jaw, back) > 15 mins
  * Associated symptoms: seating, N+V, SOB
  * Abrupt deterioration in previously stable angina with little or no exertion
* Refer to hospital for ACS protocol if signs of complications e.g. pulmonary oedema but pain free
* Refer to hospital for ACS protocol if recent ACS and develop further chest pain
* If pain free but had pain previous 12 hrs and normal ECG, or pain 12-72 hrs ago, then refer for urgent same day assessment
* Cardiovascular Hx and risk factors: Age, Hypertension, Dyslipidaemia, Diabetes, Smoking, Family Hx
* Universal definition: Cardiac biomarker (Troponin) > 99th centile upper reference limit, together with 1 of the following:
  * Symptoms of ischaemia
  * ST-T changes or LBBB
  * Pathological Q waves
  * Imaging loss of viable myocardium
* Type 1: primary coronary event
* Type 2: secondary to increased oxygen demand or reduced oxygen supply

### Stable Chest Pain

* Diagnose stable angina on clinical assessment. Typical angina if all 3, 2 = atypical, 1 = not angina:
  * Constricting discomfort in front of chest, neck shoulder jaw
  * Precipitated by exertion
  * Relived by rest or GTN
* Assess Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) risk: age, sex, DM, smoking, hyperlipidaemia
  * If > 90 %: treat as it were angina
  * 60-90 % perform coronary angiography
  * 30-60 % functional imaging
  * 10-20 % CT Calcium scoring
* Identify non coronary causes of angina such as aortic stenosis

## Investigation

* Resting 12 lead ECG as soon as possible
* Take blood sample for Troponin I or T, repeat in 10-12 hrs (expected to rise 6 hrs post event)
* If raised Troponin, reassess to exclude other causes i.e. secondary to PE, dissection
* If ST segment elevation  or new onset LBBB refer to local protocol for STEMI until firm diagnosis
* If ST segment depression or deep T wave inversion refer to NSTEMI-Unstable angina protocol
* If no ST changes but Q wave or T wave change consider refer to NSTEMI-Unstable angina protocol
* DO not exclude ACS when ECG normal, consider serial ECGs or additional ECG leads
* If NOT ACS need to exclude other life threatening conditions e.g. PE, aortic dissection, pneumonia

### Stable chest pain

* Full blood count to exclude anaemia
* For people with chest pain in whom stable angina cannot be diagnosed or excluded by clinical assessment alone, and is clinically appropriate then offer invasive coronary angiography, otherwise non-invasive functional imaging

## Management

* ACS management should not delay transfer to hospital
* Pain relief: GTN (buccal or sublingual) and IV Morphine
* Aspirin 300 mg, unless contra-indicated (written record that been given)
* Oxygen: only offer if sats < 94 %, COPD 88-92%
* Monitor: Pain, HR, Rhythm, BP, O2 sats, ECG
