# Lung Cancer

## Diagnosis

* RED FLAGS: haemoptysis OR
	* SOB
	* Cough
	* Chest / shoulder pain
	* Wt loss
	* Chest signs
	* Finger clubbing
	* Hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal)
	* Cervical / Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy
	* Features of metastasis (Bone, brain, liver etc)
	* Stridor, vena cava obstruction (elevated JVP)
  
## Investigation

* Urgent X ray per above criteria (+ suspicion: pleural effusion or slowly resolving consolidation)
* Contrast enhanced CT to include liver and adrenals to stage disease BEFORE bronchoscopy / biopsy
* PET-CT for curative patients (ie low probability of mediastinal malignancy)
* If peripheral tumour: trans-thoracic USS / CT guided biopsy
* If central primary tumour: fibreoptic bronchoscopy (where nodal staging not influencing treatment)
* Neck USS if high probability of mediastinal malignancy
* Stage M1b if curative treatment, confirm presence of distant metastasis biopsy or image (MRI/PET)
* Bone metastasis: X ray, if inconclusive then bone scan or MRI
* Spirometry in all patients with curative intent, TLCO if breathlessness is disproportionate

## Management

* Urgent referral to lung Ca MDT
* Rapid access clinics for necessary investigation
* Cancer nurse specialists
* Smoking cessation, though do not postpone surgery awaiting cessation
  
### Non-small cell lung Ca
* Offer lobectomy, if FEV1 within normal limits & good exercise tolerance
* In small tumours of borderline fitness: i.e. T1aM0N0 consider lung parenchymal sparing operations
* Perform hilar and mediastinal lymph node sampling if undergoing surgery for curative intent
* Radical radiotherapy for NSCLC I, II, III with good performance (WHO 0,1), with or without surgery suitability
* CHART regimen if I, II but medically inoperable or do not want chemotherapy
* Chemo-radiotherapy for patients with stage II or III NSCLC who are not suitable for surgery
* Offer post-operative chemotherapy to patients with good performance status (WHO 0 or 1) and T1–3 N1–2 M0 NSCLC
* Cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimen for adjuvant chemotherapy
* Chemotherapy should be offered to patients with stage III or IV NSCLC and good performance status (WHO 0, 1) to improve survival, disease control and QoL
  
### Small Cell Ca
* Consider surgery in patients with early-stage SCLC (T1–2a, N0, M0)
* Offer platinum-based combination chemotherapy to patients with extensive-stage disease SCLC
* Palliative care including symptom limited radiotherapy
* Bone metastasis hypercalcaemia: single fraction radiotherapy
