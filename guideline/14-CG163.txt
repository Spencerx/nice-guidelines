# Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (Idiopathic or Crytogenic Fibrosing Alveolitis)

## Diagnosis

* Hx suggestive:
	* Environmental, occupational and drugs exposure (methotrexate, amiodarone, ergot)
	* >45
	* Persistent SOB
	* Bilateral inspiratory crackles
	* Clubbing of fingers
	* Normal or impaired spirometry, usually restrictive but can be obstructive
	* Only diagnose with MDT input and investigation below

## Investigation

* Bloods tests to exclude: connective tissue disease
* X-ray and CT
* Lung function tests (Spirometry and TLCO)
* If still unable to diagnose: Bronchioalveloar lavage / transbronchial or surgical biopsy

## Management

### Conservative
* Smoking cessation
* Assess for pulmonary rehabilitation: 6 min walk test with pulse oximetry + QoL assessment
* “Best Supportive Care” including:
	* LTOT / Ambulatory oxygen
	* Pulmonary rehabilitation
  
### Pharmacological
* Symptomatic relief: benzodiazepines /opioids
* No evidence for disease modify pharmacological intervention
  
### Surgical:

* Lung transplantation if no contra-indication
* Palliative care
