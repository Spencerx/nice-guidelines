# COPD

## Diagnosis

* RED FLAG: haemoptysis
* Excertional breathlessness (progressive whereas asthma variable)
* No diurnal variation or night time symptoms (unlike asthma)
* >35 (if under likely asthma)
* Smoker (possibly asthma but likely COPD)
* Regular sputum
* Chronic cough (asthma rarely)
* Wheeze
* Winter bronchitis
* Cor pulonale: peripheral oedema, raised venous pressure (JVP), loud 2<sup>nd</sup> heart sound
  
## Investigation

* Spirometry: FEV1 & FEV1/FVC–note does not correlate to disability (heterogeneous disease)
	* FEV1/FVC <0.7
	* FEV1 vs % predicted
	* 50-80 Mild
	* 30–50 Moderate
	* <30 % Severe
* Reversibility: post bronchodilator spirometry to exclude asthma, or domiciliary PEFR if doubt remains. Don’t over-rely on single measure, nor test routinely, unless change in FEV1 >400 mls
* Consider alternate diagnoses if asymptomatic elderly and FEV1/FVC <0.7, or symptomatic young and >0.7
* Chest X ray to exclude other pathology
* FBC exclude anaemia or polycythaemia
* BMI
* Alpha 1 anti-trypsin if early onset
* TLCO and CT if symptoms disproportionate to spirometry impairment
* ECG and Echo cardiography to elicit symptoms of cor pulmonale
* Pulse Oximetry
* Sputum Culture
 
## Management

* MDT approach: Assessment, rapid access units, respiratory nurse specialist, physiotherapy with positive expiratory mask for sputum clearance and breathing techniques, anxiety and depression, GP assessment at least annually
  
### Conservative
*  Smoking cessation, offer NRT Bupropion or Varenicline
* Vaccination: Pneumoncoccal and annual influenza
* Advice regarding air travel if FEV1 vs predicted <50%
  
### Pharmacological
* STEP 1: SABA or SAMA, oral steroid should NOT be used for reversibility testing
* STEP 2: Stable COPD who remain breathless
* If FEV1 ≥ 50% predicted: either long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) or LAMA, if still breathless + ICS
* If FEV1 <50% predicted: either LABA with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in a combination inhaler, or LAMA
* If decline ICS then LABA + LAMA
* Inhaler best method, train patient and regularly assess ability to use
* Spacer single actuation, followed by breath or tidal breathing
* Nebuliser in distress or disabling breathlessness
* Oral corticosteroids: not recommended for long term maintenance, but for acute exacerbation in hospital
* Theophylline: only used following trial of SABA, LABA and unable to use inhaler OR in combination if symptomatic on monotherapy
* Mucolytics: chronic productive sputum cough
  
### Oxygen:
* Assess need for Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) if:
* Severe obstruction FEV1 <30% predicted
* Cor pulmonale
* Polycythaemia
* Peripheral oedema
* Cyanosis
* Raised JVP
* Sats <=92% on room air
* LTOT is indicted if PaO2 <7.3 kpa (2 x ABG 3 wks apart) when stable, or <8 kpa if nocturnal hypoxaemia, sats <90% for 30% time, and has one of:
* Secondary polycythaemia
* Nocturnal hypoxaemia (sats <90% for 30% time)
* Peripheral oedema
* Pulmonary hypertension
* LTOT: to get benefit needed >15 hrs a day, ambulatory oxygen offered if exercise desaturation
  
### Cor pulmonale: LTOT and diuretics but NOT ACE, alpha blockers, digoxin nor CCB

### Non invasive ventilation
* Type 2 respiratory failure PaCO2 >7.3 kpa
  
### Surgery
* Bullectomy if apparent on CT and FEV1 <50%
* Lung volume reduction if PaCO2 <7.3 kpa and upper lobe predominant disease
  
### Exacerbation
* GP: pulse oximetry, not routine sputum culture
* Hospital: chest X-ray, ABG, FBC, U+E, culture sputum if purulent, blood cultures if pyrexial
