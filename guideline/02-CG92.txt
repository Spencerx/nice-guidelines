# CG92 VTE Prevention

## Diagnosis

* Assess all patients on admission for increased VTE risk: reduced mobility for > 3 days
* OR reduced mobility and:
	* Active cancer or cancer treatment
	* Age over 60 years
	* Critical care admission
	* Dehydration, hence do not allow patients to become dehydrated
	* Known thrombophilias
	* Obesity (body mass index [BMI] over 30 kg/m2)
	* One or more significant medical comorbidities (for example: heart disease; metabolic, endocrine or respiratory pathologies; acute infectious diseases; inflammatory conditions)
	* Personal history or first-degree relative with a history of VTE
	* Use of hormone replacement therapy OR oestrogen-containing contraceptive therapy
	* Varicose veins with phlebitis
* OR acute surgical admission or total surgery (+ anaesthesia) time> 90 mins


* Do not offer VTE prophylaxis if any of the following bleed risks:
	* Active bleeding
	* Acquired bleeding disorders (such as acute liver failure)
	* Concurrent use of anticoagulants known to increase the risk of bleeding (such as warfarin with international normalised ratio [INR] higher than 2)
	* Lumbar puncture/epidural/spinal anaesthesia expected within the next 12 hours
	* Lumbar puncture/epidural/spinal anaesthesia within the previous 4 hours
	* Acute stroke
	* Thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 75 x 109/l)
	* Uncontrolled hypertension (230/120 mmHg or higher)
	* Untreated inherited bleeding disorders (such as haemophilia and von Willebrand's disease)

## Investigation

* n/a

## Management

### Mechanical VTE Prophylaxis
(choice based on clinical condition, patient preference)

* Anti-embolism stocking (TEDS): measured to fit limb, to produce calf pressure of 14-15 mm Hg, and ensure wear day and night till mobility increased
* Do not offer TEDS in Peripheral Artery Disease, previous by-pass grafting, peripheral neuropathy, skin condition, cardiac failure, leg or pulmonary oedema, and discontinue if patient experiences pain or discomfort
* If compression stocking not appropriate offer Foot impulse device OR Intermittent pneumatic compression, and encourage to use as much as possible

### Pharmacological Prophylaxis

* Based on local practices and clinical condition (i.e. renal function), noting Anti-platelet therapy not adequate prophylaxis:
* General medical patients: choose any of the following
	* LMWH heparin
	* Fondapariux
	* Unfractionated heparin (if eGFR < 30)
* Commence as soon as possible after risk assessment

### Patients with stroke

* Consider LMWH or unfractionated heparin if Haemorrhagic stroke and risk of haemorrhagic transformation of stroke ruled out, and immobility, dehydration or previous VTE
* Do not offer compression stockings

(See CG192)[02-CG192] for more specific details regarding each medical and surgical patient

### General medical considerations:

* Do not routinely offer VTE prophylaxis to palliative patients
* Do not routinely offer to cancer patients with oncological treatment who are ambulant

### General surgical considerations:

* Stop OCP / HRT 4 wks before surgery
* Risk benefit of stopping anti-platelet 7 days before surgery
* Regional anaesthesia has lower risk of VTE vs GA, though plan timing wrt minimising risk of epidural haematoma
* If local anaesthetic and no reduced immobility, do not routinely offer VTE prophylaxis
* Most surgery: start mechanical prophylaxis at admission and pharmacological treatment with patients with a low risk of bleeding, unless orthopaedic surgery in which case for all patients unless contra-indicated
* Do not offer VTE prophylaxis in acute traumatic or non-traumatic haemorrhage, or ruptured spinal / cranial vascular malformation, until lesion has been secured
	 
### Pregnancy and up to 6 wks post partum:

consider LMWH (or unfractionated) in the following:

* Significantly reduced mobility > 3 days / critical care admission
* > 35 yrs
* Obesity
* Dehydration
* Thrombophilia or previous VTE
* Pregnancy related risk factors (hyperemesis, pre-eclampsia etc)
* Co-morbidities
