# Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH)

## Diagnosis

* Diagnosis: Simon Broome criteria includes: Fx, Signs (Xanthomata), Cholesterol levels and DNA
* Absence of signs does not preclude diagnosis
* Pedigree Hx of at least 3 generation to include: age onset CHD, Lipid concentrations and smoking Hx
* For children at risk (one affected parent) offer DNA test and LDL-C  measurements, if both affected parents then test < 5 yrs
* Cascade testing should be offered: DNA & LDL-C measurements

## Investigation

* Familial Hypercholesteroaemia diagnosis: Total Cholesterol > 7.5 mmol/l (6.7 mmol/l if under 16) consider diagnosis OR Low density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) > 4.9 mmol/l (4.0 mmol/l if under 16), PLUS tendon xanthomata in first or second degree relative
* LDL > 13 mmol/l (Adults) > 11 mmol/l (Children) consider clinical diagnosis of homozygous FH

## Management

### Conservative

* Smoking strongly discouraged
* Diet: total fat < 30 % of total energy intake, saturated fat < 7% total, total cholesterol intake < 300 mg/day and unsaturated fats replacing saturated fat; 5 portions fruit and vegetables a day; 2 portions fish (one oily) per week
* Exercise: 30 mins a day 5 days per week of moderate intensity (bouts > 10 mins as effective as longer sessions)
* Alcohol men 3-4 units a day; women 2-3 units

### Pharmacological

* Statins (lifelong) are the initial treatment
* Dose titrated to maximum licenced in order to achieve < 50% baseline LDL-C
* Ezetimibe (reduce cholesterol absorption) should be offered in hetergygous disease, and intolerant to statin therapy (new onset muscle pain, altered LFT, GI disturbance)
* If unable to control LDL-C to an appropriate individual risk with initial statin, then offer concomitant Ezetimibe
* If unable to reduce < 50% baseline LDL-C
* Those FH patients with 2 or more cardiovascular risk factors, established or family Hx of premature CHD  should be referred for specialist treatment
* Specialist treatment may include bile acid sequestrants resin), Nicotinic acid or fibrate (Gemfibrozil)
* Fat soluble vitamin supplements should be considered alongside bile acid sequestrants
* LDL apheresis offered in instance of progressive symptomatic CHD
* Liver transplantation should be considered with homozygous disease in which lipid lowering and apheresis are not successful
