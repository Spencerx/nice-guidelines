# Urinary Incontinence in Women

## Diagnosis

* Initial assessment categorise as:
  * Stress incontinence
  * Urgency / Overactive Bladder (OAB)
  * Mixed: if stress predominates discuss OAB drugs before surgery
* Urgent Referral:
  * Microscopic haematuria in women aged 50 years and older
  * Visible haematuria
  * Recurrent or persisting UTI associated with haematuria in women > 40 years
  * Suspected malignant mass arising from the urinary tract
* Refer if palpable bladder post void
* Consider referral: persisting bladder/urethral pain; clinically benign pelvic masses; faecal incontinence; suspected neurological disease; voiding
difficulty; suspected urogenital fistulae; previous continence surgery; previous pelvic cancer surgery; previous pelvic radiation therapy

## Investigation

* DRE to routinely confirm pelvic floor muscle contraction before supervised muscle training
* Prolapse: symptomatic and at or below vaginal interoitus refer to specialist
* Urine Dip: if UTI then culture and sensitivity and treat accordingly, if dip +ve leucocytes and nitrates do not offer Abx till culture and sensitivity
* Measure post-void residual volume by bladder scan (preferred) or catheterisation in women with symptoms suggestive of voiding dysfunction or recurrent
UTI
* Cystometry (multichannel) filling and voiding, before surgery in women who have:
  * Symptoms of storage dysfunction: OAB leading to a suspicion of detrusor over-activity
  * Symptoms suggestive of voiding dysfunction or anterior compartment prolapse
  * Previous surgery for stress incontinence

## Management

### Conservative

* Lifestyle interventions:
  * Caffeine reduction in OAB
  * Fluid intake modify if high or low
  * BMI > 30 to lose weight
* Pelvic Floor Muscle Training: First line for 3 mths with stress or mixed UI (8 contractions 3 x day), and as preventative management for first
pregnancy
* Electrical stimulation biofeedback considered to motivate if cannot actively contract pelvic floor
* Bladder training: if not satisfactory add an OAB drug
* Absorbent products only as coping strategy pending definitive treatment, and as an adjunct

### Catheters

If persistent retention causing incontinence, symptomatic infections, renal dysfunction

* Intermittent urethral catheterisation if can be taught to self-catheterise
* Long-term indwelling urethral catheterisation: if can’t self catherise, other issues
* Indwelling suprapubic catheters considered as an alternative to long-term urethral catheters

### Pharmacological Management

* Anti-muscarinic OAB drugs: discuss S/E, lowest effective dose, considering other co-morbidiites
* First Line: Oxybutynin (immediate release), Tolterodine (immediate release), Darifenacin (OD)
* If OAB not successful, discuss at MDT options for further management (non therapeutic / invasive)
* Desmopressin: specifically to reduce nocturia
* Oestrogens (Intravaginal) to treat OAB symptoms in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy

### Invasive Procedures for OAB

* Botulinum toxin A: discuss intermittent catheterisation needed for variable lengths of time
* Neurostimulation: percutaneous posterior tibial nerve or percutaneous sacral stimulation only if conservative treatment ineffective and Botulism type A
declined
* Augmentation cystoplasty: conservative failed and who are willing and able to self-catheterise
* Urinary Diversion: conservative, botulism, nerve stimulation failed

### Surgical Approaches

If conservative management for SUI has failed, offer:

* Synthetic mid-urethral tape: transobturator approach, make aware of lack of long-term data
* Open colposuspension:
* Autologous rectus fascial sling
