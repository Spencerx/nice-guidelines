## Diagnosis

* All options for dialysis should be discussed including risks, efficacy, benefits and side effects, including Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis should (CAPD), Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) and ion-home or in-centre haemodialysis
* Ensure patient understands CKD is a lifelong disease
* Offer all with CKD stage 5 a choice of peritoneal or haemodialysis, but consider peritoneal dialysis first choice if:
	* Children 2 or younger
	* Adults without significant co-morbidities
	* Those with residual renal function
* When discussing options recognise patients priorities are not same as clinical priorities
* Do not switch routinely in anticipation of future complications such as encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, but consider switching if patient / carer asks
