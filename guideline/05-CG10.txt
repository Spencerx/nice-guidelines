# Diabetic Foot Problems

## Diagnosis

* Overall, 20–40% of people with diabetes have neuropathy and 20–40% have peripheral vascular disease (PVD), which are secondary to poor blood glucose control and adverse arterial risk factors (such as smoking or dyslipidaemia)
* 5% of people with diabetes may develop a foot ulcer in any year, amputation rates 0.5% per year
* MDT should normally include a diabetologist, a surgeon with the relevant expertise in managing diabetic foot problems, a diabetes nurse specialist, a podiatrist and a tissue viability nurse

### MDT should:

* Assess interventions to reduce risk of cardiovascular events, CKD or anaemia
* Assess response to medical or surgical treatment
* Assess the foot and need for specialist wound care
* Assess pain
* Assess vasculature
* Review treatment of any infection
* Determine need for interventions for prevention of Achilles tendon contracture
* Orthotic assessment


## Investigation

### Annual inspection and examination to include:

* Testing foot sensation with 10 g monofilament (max 10 sessions) or vibration (calibrated)
* Palpation of foot pulses
* Inspection for any foot deformity
* Inspection of footwear

### Categorise as:

* Low current risk (normal sensation, palpable pulses)
* Increased risk (neuropathy or absent pulses or other risk factor)
* High risk (neuropathy or absent pulses plus deformity or skin changes or previous ulcer)

### Ulcerated foot:

* Assess size of ulcer and signs of infection, gangrene, ischaemia, neuropathy
* X-ray to determine extent of foot problem, MRI if osteomyelitis suspected and X-ray not definitive
* Suspected diabetic foot infection: soft tissue from debrided base for culture

## Management

### Chronic Care

* Low risk: improve knowledge, encourage beneficial self-care
* Increased risk: refer to foot protection team (3-6 mth check), inspect feet and vascular assessment
* High risk: refer to foot protection team (1-3 mth check), inspect feet and vascular assessment
* Intensified foot education, specialist footwear/insoles, skin and nail care
* Ulcers: urgent (<24hrs) assessment by trained professional and ongoing care by MDT including podiatrists, orthotists and diabetic nurses
* Patients who would benefit from re-vascularisation should be referred promptly
* Charcot osteoarthropathy (Joint neuropathy) if red, deformity and warmth referred immediately to MDT for joint immobilisation (NB CMT is a hereditary neuromuscular condition)

### Hospital Care

* Assess < 24 hrs of diabetic foot admission, named consultant responsible for overall care
* Refer to MDT < 24 hrs
* Acute Presentation Inspection: Neuropathy;  Ischaemia; Ulceration; Inflammation and/or infection; Deformity; Charcot arthropathy
* Infection treatment per local guidelines, if mild offer PO with effect against Gram +ve

### Ulcer Management
* Debridement, dressings and off-loading (device to stop pressure) by MDT only
* Ischaemia assessment: maybe associated with redness & pain if infected or gangrenous, hence examine peripheral pulses, tissue loss, as well as colour and temperature and ABPI where possible
