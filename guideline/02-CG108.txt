# Chronic Heart Failure

## Diagnosis

* Heart failure due to Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction LVSD – reduced LV ejection fraction
* Heart failure with impaired Left Ventricle Relaxation HFPEF – preserved LV ejection fraction

## Investigation

* Suspected Heart Failure without previous MI: Measure BNP > 400 pg/ml or NT-proBNP > 2000 pg/ml should have urgent referral for 2D echo-cardiography assessment within 2 wks
* If BNP 100 - 400, NT-proBNP 400-2000 2D echo-cardiography within 6 wks
* Suspected Heart Failure with previous MI should have urgent referral for 2D echo-cardiography assessment within 2 wks
* Note: obesity, diuretics, ACE, ARB reduce BNP, and high levels can be cuased other than heart failure e.g. LVH, sepsis, hypoxaemia, renal dysfunction
* Cardiac –MRI or TOE should be considered if echo poor quality
* ECG and chest X-ray to look for aggravating factors
* FBC, LFTs, TFTs, eGFR, lipids, urinalysis


## Management

### Conservative

* Heart Failure care should be delivered by an MDT with an integrated approach across the community
* Exercise: offer group exercise based rehabilitation if stable and condition does not preclude
* Smoking cessation
* Alcohol related should abstain
* Offer annual influenza vaccination

### Pharmacological

* First Line in LV systolic dysfunction:
  * ACE inhibitor (start low and titrate upwards) or ARB if not tolerated. Measure U+Es post commencement on ACE after each dose increment
  * Beta blocker (start low, go slow) including those with PAD, IPF, DM & COPD, switching to a Beta Blocker licensed for Heart Failure
* Second Line:
* Aldosterone antagonist, especially post MI or moderate to severe HF (NY class III-IV), while monitoring potassium, eGFR, creatinine
* If afro-Caribbean then consider Hydralazine, with specialised advice
* Digoxin considered if still symptomatic
* Diuretics should be considered in congestive heart failure, especially in HFPEF where loop diuretics should be considered
* Anti-coagulants should be considered in those with a history of thromboembolism
* In HF associated with valvular disease specialist referral required, Do not start ACE until assessment made
* Regular review of functional capacity, medications and renal function
