# Opioids in Palliative Care

## Diagnosis

* When offering pain treatment with strong opioids to a patient with advanced and progressive disease, ask them about concerns such as:
	* Addiction
	* Tolerance
	* Side effects
	* Fears that treatment implies the final stages of life
* Provide verbal and written information on strong opioid treatment to patients and carers including:
	* When and why strong opioids are used to treat pain
	* How effective they are likely to be
	* Taking strong opioids for background and breakthrough pain, addressing: how, when and how often to take strong opioids & how long pain relief should last
	* Side effects and signs of toxicity
	* Safe storage
	* Follow-up and further prescribing

## Investigation

* n/a
  
## Management

### Starting Strong Opioids - Titrating the Dose:

* Regular oral sustained-release or oral immediate-release morphine (patient preference) with rescue doses of oral immediate-release morphine for breakthrough pain
* Renal or hepatic comorbidities, offer a total daily starting dose of 20–30 mg of oral morphine (i.e. 10-15 mg sustained release BD) + 5 mg immediate release PRN
* Adjust the dose until a good balance exists between acceptable pain control and side effects
  
### First Line Maintenance:

* Oral sustained-release morphine
* If oral opioids are not suitable (consider with specialist advice):
	* Transdermal patch formulations but not routinely
	* Subcutaneous morphine
  
### First Line Breakthrough Pain:

* Oral immediate-release morphine
* Do not offer fast-acting fentanyl, if pain remains inadequately controlled despite optimising treatment, consider seeking specialist advice
  
### Management of constipation
* Prescribe laxative treatment regularly at an effective dose, advise takes time to work and adherence important

### Management of nausea
* advise likely transient, if persists prescribe and optimise anti-emetic treatment before considering switching strong opioids

### Management of drowsiness
* consider dose reduction if pain is controlled or consider switching opioids if pain, specialist advice if continues
