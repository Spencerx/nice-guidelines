# Bladder Cancer

## Diagnosis
* n/a
  
## Investigation

### If bladder cancer suspected:
* Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT), white light guided with photodynamic diagnosis, cytology or urinary biomarkers
* Do not substitute urinary biomarkers for cystoscopy to investigate suspected bladder cancer
  
### Staging
* Consider CT or MRI staging before TURBT if muscle-invasive bladder cancer suspected at cystoscopy
* CT urography to detect upper tract involvement in new or high risk cancer
* Consider fluorodeoxyglucose PET if indeterminate findings on MRI / CT

## Management

### Non Muscle invasive Treatment
* Low Risk:
	* Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) white light guided with photodynamic diagnosis, cytology or urinary biomarkers
	* Obtain detrusor muscle sample and note size and number of tumours
	* Offer intravesical mitomycin C during TURBT (Chemotherapy agents via catheter to bladder)
* Intermediate Risk:
	* Offer min 6 courses of intravesical mitomycin C, if recurs refer to specialist
* High Risk:
	* Repeat TURBT in 6 weeks
	* Offer the choice of intravesical BCG (Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin) or radical cystectomy
	* Offer induction & maintenance intravesical BCG, if induction BCG fails (not tolerated, or bladder cancer persists) refer the person's cancer to a specialist urology MDT
* Consider fulguration (destruction with diathermy) without biopsy for people with recurrent non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer if solitary papillary regrowth < 3 mm
* Follow up: Cystoscopy follow up every 3 mths for 2 years if high risk
  
### Muscle Invasive Treatment

via Specialist urology MDT

* Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Cisplatin before radical cystectomy / radiotherapy
* Radical cystectomy with urinary stoma or a continent urinary diversion
* Radiotherapy with radiosensitizer
* Consider adjuvant cisplatin combination chemotherapy after radical cystectomy for people with muscle-invasive or lymph-node-positive cancer not detected  before cystectomy
* Side Effects: specialist urology MDT if symptoms of bladder toxicity after radiotherapy cannot be controlled with antispasmodics or non-opiate analgesia
* Follow up: monitoring of the upper tracts for hydronephrosis, stones and cancer using imaging and eGFR annually and monitoring for local and distant recurrence using CT abdomen, pelvis, chest
  
### Locally Advanced:
* First Line Chemo: Cisplatin or Carboplatin in combo with Gemcitabine if performance status 0-2
* Second Line: Gemcitabine in combo with cisplatin, or high-dose MVAC in combination with G-CSF

### Symptoms Management:
* Bladder symptoms: offer palliative hypofractionated radiotherapy if haematuria, dysuria, urinary frequency or nocturia caused by cancer unsuitable for curative treatment
*  Loin pain: percutaneous nephrostomy or retrograde stenting for people with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer and ureteric obstruction
