# Anaphylaxis Assessment

## Diagnosis

* Document the acute clinical features of the suspected anaphylactic reaction
* Record the time of onset of the reaction
* Record the circumstances immediately before the onset of symptoms to help to identify the trigger

## Investigation

* Mast Cell tryptase
	* Adults: timed blood sample after a suspected anaphylaxis in adults or young people > 16, first sample immediately after treatment started, second 1-2 hrs following
	* Children: if suspected to be venom-related, drug-related or idiopathic

## Management

* After emergency treatment for suspected anaphylaxis, offer referral to a specialist allergy service
* Blood sample may be required at follow-up to measure baseline mast cell tryptase
Management
* Adults and young people > 16 who have had emergency treatment for suspected anaphylaxis should be observed for 6â€“12 hours from the onset of symptoms, depending on response to emergency treatment
* Children younger than 16 years who have had emergency treatment for suspected anaphylaxis should be admitted to hospital
* Discharge: information about anaphylaxis, including
* Signs and symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction
* Risk of a biphasic reaction
* What to do if an anaphylactic reaction occurs (adrenaline injector and call emergency services)
* How to use injector
* How to avoid suspected trigger
