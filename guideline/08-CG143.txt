# Sickle Cell Acute

## Diagnosis

* Throughout an acute painful sickle cell episode, regard the patient / carer as an expert in their condition, listen to their views and discuss: previous treatment, planned treatment, their concerns
* Moderate pain: VAS score 4-7
* Severe pain: VAS score >7
  
## Investigation

* Clinically assess: BP; Sats (<95%, offer O2); HR; RR; temperature

## Management

### Analgesia
* Offer analgesia < 30 mins of presentation with an acute painful sickle cell episode:
	* Account for analgesia taken for the current episode before presentation
	* Ensure drug, dose and administration route are suitable for the severity of the pain and age
	* Refer to the patient's individual care plan if available
* Opioid bolus to all patients in severe pain OR moderate pain whoâ€™ve already had some analgesia
* Offer all patients regular paracetamol and NSAIDs in addition to opioid unless contra-indicated
* Assess the effectiveness of pain relief:
* Every 30 min until satisfactory pain relief achieved using an age-appropriate pain scoring tool
* If severe pain on reassessment, offer a second bolus dose of a strong opioid
* Consider patient-controlled analgesia if repeated bolus doses of strong opioid needed within 2 hrs
* If taking an Opioid offer, and monitor every hour for first 6 hours:
	* Laxatives on a regular basis
	* Anti-emetics as needed
	* Antipruritics as needed
  
### Complications:
* Be aware of the possibility of acute chest syndrome with the following symptoms:
	* Abnormal respiratory signs and/or symptoms
	* Chest pain
	* Fever
	* Signs and symptoms of hypoxia: Sats < 95% or an escalating O2 requirement
* Acute stroke
* Aplastic crisis
* Infections
* Osteomyelitis
* Splenic sequestration (trapping of sickles cells)
* Do not use corticosteroids in the management of an uncomplicated acute painful sickle cell episode
* Encourage own coping mechanisms (for example, relaxation techniques) for dealing with acute pain
