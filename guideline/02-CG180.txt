# Atrial Fibrillation

## Diagnosis

* Manual pulse palpation in patients with:
  * SOB
  * Palpitations
  * Syncope / dizziness
  * Chest discomfort
  * Stroke / TIA
* Stroke risk: CHA2DS2VASc if AF (symptomatic or not, paroxysmal or persitent, atrial flutter, or risk of arrhythmia recurrence) note for most people benefit of anti-coagulation outweighs bleeding risk, unless increased risk of bleed
* Bleeding risk once started anti-coagulation: HAS-BLED. Offer to modify hypertensive risk, poor control of INR, concurrent NSAID, excessive alcohol consumption

## Investigation

* ECG: If detect irregularly irregular pulse
* If paroxysmal AF suspected then ambulatory 24 hr ECG monitor if asymptomatic episodes or symptomatic < 24 hrs apart
* Transthoracic echo (TTE) in AF:
  * Baseline important
  * Rhythm control requiring cardioversion (Pharmacological or electrical)
  * Suspicion of underlying structural / functional heart disease influencing management
  * Refinement of risk stratification for anti-thrombotic therapy (NOT if already agreed initiation)
* Transoesophageal echo (TOE) in AF, when TTE demonstrates an abnormality i.e. valvular disease or where TTE is technically difficult
* Personalised care plan: stroke awareness; rate and rhythm control; anti-coagulation

## Management

* Anti-coagulation: if CHADSVASc > 2 in both sexes or > 1 in men
  * Stroke (2)
  * Age > 75 (2)
  * Diabetes (1)
  * Cardiac Failure (1)
  * Hypertension (1)
  * Age > 65 (1)
  * Vascular Hx (1)
  * Sex (female) (1)
* New Anti-platelet: Apixaban, Dabigatran Rivaroxiban can be considered instead of Warfarin
* Vitamin K antagonist: assess Time in Therapeutic Range
* Reassess control if 2 INR > 5.0 or 1 > 8.0 OR 2 INR < 1.5, TTR < 65 %, addressing non adherence
* Do not offer Aspirin monotherapy for stroke prevention
* Review stoke risk of patients not taking an anti-coagulant when reach 65 or develop DM, HF, PAD, CHD, TIA

### Chronic AF (assuming anti-coagulated as necessary)

* Rate Control in first instance unless:
* AF has reversible cause
* Heart failure caused by AF
* New onset AF
* Atrial flutter that could benefit from ablation
* Rhythm control preferred in clinical judgement

### Rate Control: Beta Blocker or rate controlling CCB (Diltiazem)
* Digoxin: only if non paroxysmal and sedentary patient

If monotherapy does not control symptoms and poor ventricular rate control then any two of: Beta Blocker; Diltiazem; Digoxin

### Rhythm Control: consider if heart rate is not controlled with rate controlling steps

* If > 48 hrs offer electrical cardioversion (with amiodarone 4 wks before and 12 weeks after)
* TOE Cardioversion should be offered alongside conventional cardioversion, equally effective
* Drug treatment for long term rhythm control consider standard Beta Blocker i.e. all except Sotolol
* Dronedarone recommended for maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion
* Amidarone if LVF or HF
* ‘Pill in pocket’ for paroxysmal AF if no  LVF, Valvular pathology of IHD (single dose anti-arhythmic)
* Left Atrial ablation: Catheter if paroxysmal or Surgical if symptomatic
* Pace and ablate if permanent symptomatic AF

### Acute AF

* If life threatening then electrically cardiovert without waiting for anti-coagulation
* If non- life threatening and < 48 hr (ie not long enough for clot formation) can offer rhythm or rate control
* If > 48 hrs rate control only
* Type of cardioversion (drug or electrical) dependent on resources available
* If pharmacological then consider Flecanide (if no IHD) or Amiodarone
* Anti-coagulate with heparin until full assessment made OR Warfarin if unlikely to regain sinus rhythm
