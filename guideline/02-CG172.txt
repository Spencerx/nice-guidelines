# CG172 MI Secondary Prevention

## Diagnosis

* n/a

## Investigation

* GP follow Up including: BP, renal function
* Offer assessment of LV function


## Management

### Cardiac rehabilitation programs

Range of options with an exercise component to meet needs of all ages, including those with LV dysfunction, taking account of health beliefs.

* Rehabilitation programs should include health education and stress management, though not CBT routinely
* Use of metabolic equivalents (METS) can be used to compare activities
* Sexual activity can resume 4 weeks after MI, PDE5 inhibitor may be considered 6 mths after event who are now stable (though avoided in patients treated with nitrates)
* Lifestyle changes
	* Diet: Mediterranean (more fish, bread, less meat, more plant oils), note omega 3 fatty acid has no evidence of benefit or harm
	* Alcohol reduction 3-4 /day men, 2-3 women
	* Smoking cessation
	* Exercise 20 mins a day till become slightly breathless and aim to extend
	* Weight management advice

### Medical therapy

* ACE or ARB if intolerant, as soon as haemodynamically stable, and renal function testing 1-2 wks
* Beta Blocker, as soon as haemodynamically stable, min 12 mths and indefinitely in LV dysfunction
* Cholesterol lowering medication (statin)
* Dual anti-platelet (aspirin plus other anti-platelet), unless they have an indication for anti-coagulation. Clopidogrel monotherapy if aspirin not tolerated, or if other clinical vascular disease
* Ticagralor with aspirin for 12 months if STEMI
* Clopidogrel with aspirin for 12 months in NSTEMI or those with bare metal stent, or STEMI with medical management
* Continue 2nd anti-platelet for up to 12 months if had STEMI and CABG
* If anti-coagulated add aspirin unless there is a high risk of bleeding if patient undergone CABG, balloon angioplasty and medical management, not if stented
* If stented add clopidogrel (not aspirin) to the anti-coagulant regime
* Do not routinely add Ticagrelor or Prasugel to warfarin post MI
* Post 12 months consider need for ongoing anti-platelet treatment taking into account thromboembolic vs bleeding risk and cardiovascular risk
* If heart failure symptoms / signs, consider aldosterone antagonist within 3-14 days, post ACE
* All patients with MI should have cardiologist review for revasculaisation
