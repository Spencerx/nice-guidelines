# Hip Fracture

## Diagnosis

* Offer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if hip fracture is suspected despite negative X-rays
  
## Investigation
* n/a
  
## Management

* Ensure the following co-morbidities are corrected to ensure surgery not delayed: Anaemia; Anti-coagulation; Volume depletion; Electrolyte imbalance; Uncontrolled diabetes; Uncontrolled heart failure or arrhythmia; Acute or  exacerbation of chest infection
* Analgesia
	* Assess patients' pain immediately upon presentation, then 30 mins, then hrly till settled on ward then regularly as part of nursing observation
	* Analgesia should be sufficient to allow joint manipulation for assessment
	* Paracetamol 6 hrly pre-operatively unless contra-indicated
	* Opioids if Paracetamol ineffective
	* NSAIDs **are not** recommended
* Anaesthesia: Offer Ga or spinal discussing risk / benefits
  
### Surgical Procedures
* Displaced intracapsular fracture: Offer replacement arthroplasty either hemiarthroplasty or Total Hip Replacement
* THR: if able to walk independently, not cognitively impaired, medically fit for anaesthesia
* By inference: cemented arthroplasty reserved for very elderly / immobile (or unfit for prolonged GA)
* Arthroplasty: Use proven femoral stem design rather than Austin Moore or Thompson stems
* Undisplaced: fixation with screws (arthroplasty for those patients who are less fit)
* Trochanteric fractures (above and including the lesser trochanter): Use extramedullary implants such as a sliding (dynamic) hip screw in preference to an intramedullary nail
* Subtrochanteric fracture including femoral shaft fracture: Use an intramedullary nail
