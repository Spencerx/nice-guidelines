# Faecal Incontinence

## Diagnosis

* Focussed baseline assessment required: identify contributory factors
	* Hx and Exam including Ano-rectal examination
	* Cognitive assessment where necessary
* Management of condition specific interventions:
	* Faecal loading
	* Treatable: Infective; IBD etc
	* Lower Gastro Cancer
	* Rectal prolapse
	* Anal sphincter injury (3rd and 4th degree obstetric injury)
	* Cauda equine / disc prolapse

## Investigation

* n/a

## Management

### Conservative


* Diet manage stool consistency, modify 1 item a time, nutritionally balanced, consider malnutrition
* Dehydration / hard stools: manage 1.5 Litres per day
* Bowel habit training: post meal, private accessible toilet, avoid straining, sitting or squatting
* Emotional and psychological support
* Offer continence products: sufficient body worn disposable pads, anal plug, skin care, odour control

### Medication


* Consider drugs that may cause incontinence, excessive laxative use or dietary factors first
* Offer anti-diarrhoeal (Loperamide) once these causes excluded, initial low dose, increased as req’d
* Do not give Loperamide if: Acute diarrhoea without known cause, UC, hard stools
* If faecally loaded: rule out obstruction then offer rectal laxative, or oral if unsuccessful

### Specialist Intervention – especially neurological spinal disease / injured patients


* Pelvic floor muscle retraining: monitored by digital assessment
* Bowel retraining
* Rectal irrigation
* Electrical stimulation
* If remain symptomatic consider: ano-rectal physiology studies and imaging
* If remain symptomatic: emotional and psychological support, 6 mth review
* If cognitively impaired consider behavioural and functional analysis to determine if behavioural

### Surgical


* Surgical repair for those with full length external sphincter defect greater than 90 degrees
* Factors reducing effectiveness: pudendal nerve injury, internal sphincter injury, external atrophy
* If surgery not an option consider sacral nerve stimulation
* If nerve stimulation unsuccessful consider neo-sphincter: graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter
