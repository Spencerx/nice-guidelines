# Pneumonia

## Diagnosis

* Note: HAP develops >48 hrs after admission
* Symptoms of LRTI: fever, sputum, SOB, wheeze, chest pain if no other explanation present
* Clinical diagnosis: symptoms and signs w/o chest X-ray
* When managed in hospital diagnosis usually confirmed by chest X-ray

## Investigation

### Primary care
* CRP: if <20 do not offer Anti-biotics; if >20 delayed script; >100 offer anti-biotics
* CRB65 (i.e no Urea): Confusion AMTS <8; RR >30; Systolic <90 Diastolic <60
	* 0 = Home care
	* 2 = Hospital care
  
### Secondary care
* CURB65: Urea >7 mmol/l
	* 0-1 = low risk
	* 2 = Intermediate
	* 3-4 = Severe hence ITU consideration
* Microbiology should only be offered for intermediate risk and above
* Microbiology: Blood & sputum cultures + Legionella & Pneumococcal urinary antigen tests

## Management

* Anti-biotics as soon as possible after diagnosis
* (Xray) usually within 4 hrs
* CAP Low severity
	* Amoxicllin favoured, Macrolide or tetracycline if penicillin allergic
	* Consider extending course beyond 5 days if no response in 3 days
* CAP Moderate & High severity
	* Consider dual therapy Amoxicillin and a macrolide
	* 7-10 day course
	* Add beta-lactamase for high severity
* CAP Do not discharge if within 24 hrs have had:
	* Temperature higher than 37.5°C
	* Respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute or more
	* Heart rate over 100 beats per minute
	* Systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg or less
	* Oxygen saturation under 90% on room air
	* Abnormal mental status
	* Inability to eat without assistance
* HAP anti-biotic in line with local policy, 5-10 day course
