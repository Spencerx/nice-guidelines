# Osteoarthritis

## Diagnosis

* Diagnose osteoarthritis clinically without investigations if a person:
	* Is 45 or over and
	* Has activity-related joint pain and
	* Has either no morning joint-related stiffness or morning stiffness that lasts < 30 minutes
* Trauma, hot swollen joint, prolonged morning joint stiffness indicate other diagnosis
* Assess the effect of OA on the person's function, QoL, occupation, mood, relationships and leisure
* Agree a plan with the person (family, carers as appropriate) for managing their osteoarthritis

## Investigation
* n/a
  
## Management

### Conservative:
* Education: accurate information to enhance understanding of the condition and its management, and to counter misconceptions, such as that it inevitably progresses and cannot be treated
* Self-care: agree individualised self-management strategies
* Core Therapy:
* Exercise, irrespective of age, comorbidity, pain severity or disability and should include:
	* Local muscle strengthening and
	* General aerobic fitness
* Weight loss: offer interventions to achieve loss (weight multiplies load)
* Adjuncts:
* Thermotherapy: use of local heat or cold should be considered as an adjunct to core treatments
* Electrotherapy: consider the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) as adjunct
* Aids and devices: offer advice on appropriate footwear and bracing for joint instability
* Do Not offer:
	* Nutraceuticals: Do not offer glucosamine or chondroitin for management of OA
	* Acupuncture: Do not offer acupuncture for the management of OA
  
### Pharmacological Therapy:
* NICE not completed review
* Paracetamol regularly for pain relief in addition to core treatments
* NSAID (topical) for pain relief in addition to core treatments with knee or hand osteoarthritis
* NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor if non selective NSAID/Paracet ineffective, lowest dose shortest duration
* NSAID/COX-2 inhibitor: varying gastrointestinal, liver and cardio-renal toxicity
* Intra-articular corticosteroid injections as adjunct to core treatments for moderate to severe pain
  
### Surgical Joint:
* Should be offered core therapies, and discuss risk benefit of surgery
* Referral threshold base on joint discussion between patient, referrer and surgeon
* Refer for joint symptoms (pain, stiffness and reduced function) that have a substantial impact on QoL and refractory to non-surgical treatment, age, sex obesioty are not barriers
* Do not refer for arthroscopic lavage and debridement as treatment unless knee OA with clear history of mechanical locking
* Follow up and review
