# Acute Kidney Injury

## Diagnosis

* Ensure AKI considered if presents with illness and has CKD, or new onset urological symptoms
	* Investigate for AKI if
	* eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 (Stage 2)
	* Oliguria, Hypovolaemia, Neurological dysfunction reliance of carer for hydration
	* Nephrotoxic drugs: NSAID, ACE/ARB, Diuretic, Aminoglycosides, ioidiated contrast past wk
	* Heart Failure, Liver disease, Sepsis, Symptoms of urological obstruction
	* > 65 yrs, Hx of AKI
	* Deteriorating EWS
	* Children: Diarrhoea, Haematological malignancy

## Investigation

* Measure serum creatinine, compare with baseline, noting in CKD a rise in creatinine may mean acute kidney injury on chronic versus worsening chronic
* CG50 track and trigger systems (EWS) used to identify patients at risk of AKI, EWS paeds aggregate weighted measure to include: HR, RR, SBP, GCS, Sats, Temp, Cap refill
* If at risk measure: urine output, weight (fluid balance), U+Es, Lactate, ABG
  
###  Detection criteria for AKI:
* Rise of serum creatinine of > 26 micromol/l in less than 48 hrs
* 50 % rise in serum creatinine over 7 days
* Fall in urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/hr for more than 6 hours (8 hr in children)
* Children: >25 % fall in eGFR over 7 days
  
### Identify Cause
* Urinalysis: urine dip protein, blood, leucocytes, nitrates and glucose,
* Nephritis must be considered if haematuria & proteinuria w/o UTI or trauma or other cause known
* USS: do not routinely offer if cause of AKI has been identified, unless pyelonephritis or risk of urinary tract obstruction
  
## Management

### Preventing Acute Kidney Injury
* Contrast agents measure eGFR, at risk if:
	* eGFR < 40, diabetes, heart failure, renal transplant, hypovolaemia, > 75, increased volume or inter arterial use of contrast
	* Patients should be volume expanded
	* Stop ACE / ARB if eGFR < 40
* Surgery at risk if: emergency or intraperitoneal surgery, eGFR < 60, diabetes, heart failure, liver failure, > 65, Nephrotoxic drugs incl NSAIDs
* Consider temporarily stopping ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with diarrhoea, vomiting or sepsis until their clinical condition has improved
  
### Urological Obstruction:
* Refer if obstructed single kidney, bilateral upper tract obstruction, pyonephrosis, complications due to obstruction
  
### Pharmacological Management
* Loop diuretic: not routine in AKI but if fluid overload / oedema awaiting transplant or improving
  
### Renal Replacement
* Discuss with nephrologist, whether benefit if significant co-morbidity, decide on overall condition
* Refer for replacement in following if not responding to medical management: hyperkalaemia,  metabolic acidosis, uraemia leading to pericarditis, fluid overload / oedema
* Specialist: diagnosis of vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, myeloma; AKI w/o known cause; inadequate response; stage 3 AKI, CKD stage 4-5, eGRF < 30 following AKI
