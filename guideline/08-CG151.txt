# Neutropenic Sepsis Prevention

## Diagnosis

* Patients before starting and throughout their anticancer treatment, should have information on:
	* Neutropenic sepsis
	* How and when to contact 24-hour specialist oncology advice
	* How and when to seek emergency care
* Neutropenia: neutrophil count 0.5×109 per litre or lower
* Neutropenic sepsis: temp > 38 or other signs symptoms consistent with clinically significant sepsis
* Suspect neutropenic sepsis in patients having anticancer treatment who become unwell, and refer to secondary or tertiary care

## Investigation

* In suspected neutropenic sepsis perform: FBC, U+Es, LFTs incl albumin, CRP, lactate, blood culture
  
## Management

* Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis: Adults with acute leukaemias, stem cell transplant or solid tumours in whom neutropenia is anticipated due to chemotherapy (for period of neutropenia)
  
### Managing Neutropenic Sepsis in Secondary Care:
* Treat as medical emergency
* Empirical antiobiotics: Beta lactam monotherapy with Piperacillin and Tazobactam
* Do not offer Aminoglycoside
* Do not offer empiric glycopeptide in suspected neutropenic sepsis who have central venous access
* Do not switch initial empiric antibiotics if unresponsive fever unless clinical deterioration or a microbiological indication
* Switch from IV to oral antibiotic therapy after 48 hours of treatment in low risk patients
* Do not remove central venous access devices as part of management
* Try to identify underlying cause:
	* Additional peripheral blood culture if central venous access if feasible
	* Urinalysis in all children aged under 5 years
* No chest X ray unless clinically indicated
  
### Risk Assess

Using presentation features and a validated risk scoring tool:

* Low risk: outpatient antibiotic therapy for patients accounting for social and clinical situation
* High risk: review the patient's clinical status daily, reassess the patient's risk of septic complications
* Continue inpatient empiric antibiotic therapy in all patients who have unresponsive fever unless an alternative cause of fever is likely
