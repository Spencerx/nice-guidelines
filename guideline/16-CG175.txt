# Prostate Cancer

## Diagnosis

* Use normograms to convey: biopsy result prediction, pathological stage, risk of treatment failure

## Investigation

* Biopsy: Use PSA result together with DRE (digital rectal exam), co-morbidity and risk factors (Age and Afro- Caribbean) to decide on need, not PSA alone, and not if
evidence of bone metastasis
* Core Biopsy by trans-rectal ultrasound guided technique
* If negative core biopsy (10-12) then offer multi-parametric MRI to guide another biopsy, if negative then do not repeat biopsy
* Staging, only if candidate to radical treatment
* Isotope bone scans: if hormonal treatment being deferred and risk of bone complications, but not if low risk localised cancer
* Multi-parameter MRI or CT (MRI contra-indicated): if knowledge of T or N stage could affect management

| Level of Risk | PSA      |     | Gleason Score |     | Clinical Stage |
| ------------- | -------- | --- | ------------- | --- | -------------- |
| Low           | <10ng/ml | and | <6            | and | T1–T2          |
| Intermediate  | 10–20    | or  | 7             | or  | T2b            |
| High          | >20ng/ml | or  | 8–10          | or  | T2c or more    |

## Management

### Hormone Therapy

* Zoladex (LHRH agonist) reduced testosterone, note GnRH antagonists not widely available. Consider intermittent therapy for long-term androgen deprivation therapy
(not adjuvant setting), check PSA every 3 mths, restart if > 10 ng/ml
* Will reduce libido & sexual function (ejaculation and fertility): see managing adverse effects below
* Offer medroxyprogesterone (20 mg per day), initially 10 weeks, to manage troublesome hot flushes

### Low Risk Localised Prostate Cancer

* Offer active surveillance for whom radical therapy an option: Initial MRI, then regular PSA and PSA kinetics, DRE, re-biopsy at 12 mths and continuation to 5 yrs or
beyond until active surveillance end
* Offer radical treatment if chosen surveillance and evidence of progression
* Before radical therapy: discuss loss of sexual experience, ejaculation, fertility, and urinary function

### Intermediate & High Risk Localised Prostate Cancer

* Radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy, active surveillance requested, intermediate risk only
* Radical radiotherapy: offer in combination with 6 mths androgen deprivation therapy (before, during and after), with minimum dose of 74 Gy to the prostate at no
more than 2 Gy per fraction
* Consider continuing androgen deprivation therapy for 3 yrs post intervention
* Consider high-dose rate brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiotherapy
* Surgery: robotic systems cost effective

### Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer

* Clinical oncologists should consider pelvic radiotherapy in men with locally advanced prostate cancer who have a higher than 15% risk of pelvic lymph node
involvement

### Managing Adverse Effects

* Sexual dysfunction: access top ED specialists and PDE-5 inhibitors, or vacuum devices, intraurethral inserts or penile injections, or penile prostheses
* Urinary incontinence: access to specialist, coping strategies, along with pelvic floor muscle re-education, bladder retraining and pharmacotherapy, as well as
surgery (artificial urinary sphincter)
* Investigation radiation induced enteropathy
* Osteoporosis: only give Bisphosphonates (Denosumab if contra-indicated) if pre-existing
* Gynacomastia: breast bud radiotherapy or wkly Tamoxifen if long-term bicalutamide monotherapy

### Follow up

* Watchful waiting regimen, no curative intent should be followed up in primary care
* Check PSA levels for all men with prostate cancer who are having radical treatment at the earliest 6 weeks following treatment, at least every 6 months for the
first 2 year

### Relapse

* Biochemical relapse (a rising PSA) alone should not prompt an immediate change in treatment
* Do not offer biopsy of the prostatic bed if had a radical prostatectomy
* Offer radical radiotherapy to the prostatic bed If no known metastases
* Biochemical evidence of hormone relapsed disease: Docetaxel recommended (performance > 60%)
* Bisphosphonates for pain relief if other treatments failed (analgesics and palliative radiotherapy)

### Metastatic Prostate Cancer

* Offer bilateral orchidectomy to all men with metastatic prostate cancer as alternate to LH agonist
* In hope of retaining sexual function offer anti-androgen monotherapy with bicalutamide
