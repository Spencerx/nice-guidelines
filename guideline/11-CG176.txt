# Head Injury

## Diagnosis

* High energy impact: fall > 1 m; ejected from motor vehicle; High speed motor vehicle; bicycle
* Open or depressed skull fracture signs:
* Basal of skull, open or depressed fracture signs: Mastoid ecchymosis (bruising); Panda eyes w/o associated damage around eye; Bleeding from one or both ears
* Telephone referral: Unconscious; Focal neurology; Seizure; High energy; Suspicion of head injury
* Primary referral: Above + GCS < 15; Amnesia; Persistent headache; Vomiting; Anti-coagulation; NAI
  
## Investigation

* GCS, state denominator and whether learning / neuro disability baseline
* CT imaging of choice to detect acute clinically significant brain injury
* CT head within 1 hr if:
	* GCS < 13 on initial assessment (< 14 children)
	* GCS < 15 after 2 hours of presentation
	* Suspect open or depressed skull facture
	* Focal neurology
	* Post traumatic seizure
	* > 1 episode of vomiting
* CT head within 8 hrs:
	* > 65 yrs
	* Clotting disorder
	* Warfarinised
	* High energy
	* > 30 retrograde amnesia before event
* CT cervical spine:
	* GCS < 13 on initial assessment
	* Intubated
	* Plain x-ray inadequate or suspicious
	* Definitive diagnosis required i.e. before surgery
	* Alert stable but: > 65; High energy impact; Paraesthesia in limbs; Focal neuropathy
* Assess range of movement only if none of above applies and one of the following:
	* Ambulatory and sitting comfortably
	* No midline cervical tenderness
	* Involved in simple rear end MVC
* X-ray cervical spine (3 planes): if neck pain but no indication as above for CT
* CT imaging of brain / cervical involve radiology department, reassess if initially considered low risk
* CT should cover any areas of concern on X-ray or clinical grounds including cervical spine
* If patient returns within 48 hrs then senior review +/- CT scan
* MRI (angiography) if injury referable to cervical spine especially is vascular injury due to vertebral misalignment, fracture of foramina tranversaria, lateral processes
* MRI has a role in ligamentous and disc injuries highlighted by CT / X-ray
* Discuss w/ neurosurgeon new ‘surgically significant’ imaging abnormality: ‘significant’ agree locally
* Discuss with neurosurgeon: Persistent GCS < 8 (coma); Deteriorating GCS; Progressive neurological signs; CSF leak; Seizure w/o recovery; Suspected penetrating injury
  
## Management

* ATLS, ITLS, APLS
* Neck immobilisation if: GCS < 15; Neck pain; Focal Neurology; Paraesthesia in extremities; Suspicion
* Manage pain as can lead to rise in ICP
* If GCS < 8 involve an anaesthetist
* Transfer to Neurosurgical unit:
	* Consider occult injury
	* Designated consultant to establish transfer arrangements
	* Accompanied by doctor with adequate training and means of communication
	* Complete resuscitation and stabilisation before transfer
	* Intubate and ventilate if GCS < 8
* Admit if:
	* New imaged abnormality; GCS not returned to 15; Continued worrying signs; CT not done
* Observation: ½ hrly until GCS back to 15, then ½ hrly for 2 hrs, 1 hrly for 4 hrs, 2 hrly thereafter
* Urgent reappraisal if 1 point dropped for > 30 mins
* Discharge only once GCS = 15 and suitable supervision at home (24 hrs), but explain risk factors that means should return per referral guidelines in diagnosis above
