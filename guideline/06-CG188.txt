# Gallstone Disease

## Diagnosis* Reassure that asymptomatic stones found in biliary tree or gallbladder do not need intervention unless become symptomatic

## Investigation* LFTs and USS to those with suspected gall stone disease* If LFTs abnormal or USS shows dilated duct but no stones, consider MRCP* Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) if MRCP does not allow diagnosis

## Management

### Gall bladder stones* Laproscopic cholecystectomy if symptomatic gall stones: elective day case within 1 wk* Percutaneous cholecystostomy to manage empyema if conservative failed / surgery contraindicated
  
### Common bile duct stones* Bile duct clearance by ERCP then Lap Cholecystectomy* OR Lap Chole + surgical clearance same time* If ERCP cannot clear, then use biliary stenting
