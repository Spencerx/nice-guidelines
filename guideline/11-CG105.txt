# Motor Neurone Disease

## Diagnosis

* MDT: Neurologist, Respiratory Physician, MND specialist, Respiratory Phyiologist & Physiotherapist. Palliative Care specialist and SALT
* Monitor for symptoms of respiratory impairment:
	* Breathlessness
	* Orthopnoea
	* Recurrent chest infections
	* Disturbed sleep
	* Non-refreshing sleep
	* Nightmares
	* Daytime sleepiness
	* Poor concentration and/or
	* Memory
	* Confusion
	* Hallucinations
	* Morning headaches
	* Fatigue
	* Poor appetite
* Signs:
	* Increased respiratory rate
	* Shallow breathing
	* Weak cough[ (PEFR)
	* Weak sniff
	* Abdominal paradox (inward movement of the abdomen during inspiration)
	* Use of accessory muscles of respiration
	* Reduced chest expansion on maximal inspiration

## Investigation

* Oxygen saturation
* Forced Vital Capacity. If < 50 % predicted discuss treatment, specialist referral and impact
* Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure. If <  40 cmH2O discuss treatment, specialist referral and impact
* If bulbar palsy then measure O2 sats, but not other function tests if interfaces not available
* Perform ABG is Sats < 94 %, with no lung disease, < 92% with lung disease
* If sleep related problems or Orthopnoea, but Sats > above limits then refer to specialist
* If PaCO2 > 6 kpa refer to specialist to be seen within 1 week

## Management

* Offer advice on Non-invasive ventilation at appropriate time, sensitively but soon after diagnosis, and assess carer support and training needs
* Offer NIV is symptoms and signs likely to benefit, or trial only if likely to benefit first from improvement in sleep related symptoms
* Before starting NIV, MDT should consider:
	* Tolerance
	* Risk of ventilator failure
	* How easily may get to hospital
	* Need for humidifier
* Before commencing NIV, MDT to develop care plan
* Planning end of life care: Discuss at commencement or decline of NIV; becoming more dependent on NIV, or when they ask
