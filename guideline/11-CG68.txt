# Stroke

## Diagnosis

* FAST: Outside hospital Face Arms Speech Test
* ROSIER Recognition of Stroke in Emergency Room
* If Thrombotic
	* Carotid (80%): unilateral motor +/- amourosis fugax
	* Verterobasilar (20%): bi-lateral visual, hemiparesis
  
## Investigation

TIA suspected, conduct assessment ASAP:

* ABCD<sup>2</sup> score: Age >60 =1; BP >140/90 =1; Clinical  Unilateral weakness =2, speech disturbance =1; Duration > 60 min = 2, 10-59 = 1; Diabetes =1
  
### Imaging
* Brain Scan: Diffusion weighted MRI
* TIA suspected but symptoms resolved: specialist review within 1 week before imaging
* TIA + ABCD<sup>2</sup> > 4: Urgent brain scan if pathology uncertain
* Acute Stroke: Urgent brain scan if on anti-coagulant; known bleeding disorder; GCS < 13; Unexplained fluctuating symptoms; Papilloedema; Severe headache at onset of stroke symptoms
* Carotid Imaging (Doppler) If candidates for carotid endarterectomy, within 1 week

## Management

* Transient Ischemic Attack: symptoms signs resolved within 24 hrs
* ABCD<sup>2</sup> > 4 or < 3 but stroke suspected: 300 mg aspirin loading dose + secondary prevention measures (RCP recommend 75 mg clopidogrel and statin)
* Crescendo TIA (> 2 in a week) treat for high risk stroke
  
### Carotid Endarterectomy
* If stable non disabling stroke or TIA, should undergo surgery within 2 wks if carotid stenosis between 50-99 % as well as receiving best medical treatment
* If < 50% best medical treatment only (BP, Anti-platelet, Cholesterol lowering, lifestyle advice)
  
### Acute Stroke
* Alteplase in conjunction with level 1 & 2 nursing and access to imaging and per marketing authorisation (BNF 2.10.2 states within 4.5 hrs)
* If inter-cerebral haemorrhage excluded by imaging: 300 mg Aspirin PO or rectally if dysphagic, started within 24 hrs and continued for 14 days
* After 14 days definitive anti-thrombotic (e.g. 75 mg Clopidogrel)
* If also in AF treat with 300 mg Aspirin only for 14 days, before considering ant-coagulant
* If already receiving anticoagulants: Prosthetic valves stop and replace with Aspirin 300 mg for 7 days, but if DVT/PE should receive anti-coagulant instead
* If dyspeptic then offer + PPI, intolerant consider alternate anti-platelet
* Treat O2 sats < 94 %, 4 > CBG > 11, hypertensive emergencies
* Swallow test < 24 hrs: if unable to feed orally given NGT +/- bridle or gastrostomy if cannot tolerate
* Hydration and nutrition: BMI + The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST)
* Food and fluids should be given in form that reduces risk of aspiration (Pneumonia) ie. thickened
* Mobilise as soon as possible: key concept in initial care
  
### Non Thrombotic Presentations
* Venous Sinus Thrombosis: Anticoagulate INR 2-3
* If Haemorrhagic stroke: Reverse anti-coagulation IV Vit K + Prothrombin Complex (Beriplex)
  
### Surgery
* Neurosurgical treatment may be indicated for a very small number of carefully selected patients
* Previously fit people should be considered for surgical intervention following primary intracranial haemorrhage if they have hydrocephalus
