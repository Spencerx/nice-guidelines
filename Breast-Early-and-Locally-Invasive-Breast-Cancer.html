<h2>Management</h2>

<h3>Surgery</h3>

<ul>
<li>Treat patients with early invasive breast cancer, irrespective of age, with surgery and appropriate systemic therapy, rather than endocrine therapy alone, unless significant comorbidity precludes</li>
<li>DCIS: breast conserving surgery for DCIS a minimum of 2 mm radial margin of excision, do not perform SLNB routinely in this case</li>
<li>Pagets local: breast conserving surgery with removal of the nipple-areolar complex as an alternative to mastectomy</li>
<li>Axilla: sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) / minimal surgery, vs lymph node clearance, to stage axilla if early invasive breast cancer and no evidence of lymph node involvement on USS</li>
<li>Positive SLNB (macro or micrometastases): further axillary treatment</li>
<li>Breast Reconstruction: discuss immediate breast reconstruction with all patients who are being</li>
<li>advised to have a mastectomy</li>
</ul>


<h3>Post- Operative Assessment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Assess oestrogen receptor (ER) status of all invasive breast cancers</li>
<li>Test human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) status of all invasive breast cancers</li>
<li>Consider adjuvant therapy for all patients with early invasive breast cancer post surgery at MDT</li>
</ul>


<h3>Chemotherapy</h3>

<ul>
<li>Offer Chemotherapy agent Docetaxel to patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer as part of an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen</li>
<li>Early invasive ER positive breast cancer who are not low risk Initial adjuvant offer Aromatase inhibitor (Anastrozole or Letrozole) if post menopausal or previously treated with tamoxifen</li>
<li>Offer adjuvant ovarian ablation/suppression in addition to tamoxifen to premenopausal women with ER-positive early invasive breast cancer who decline chemotherapy</li>
</ul>


<h3>Biologics</h3>

<ul>
<li>Trastuzumab, at 3-week intervals for 1 year or until disease recurrence, as an adjuvant treatment to women with HER2-positive early invasive breast cancer following surgery</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bone Loss</h3>

<ul>
<li>Early invasive breast cancer should have baseline dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan if  starting adjuvant aromatase inhibitor treatment or have treatment-induced menopause</li>
</ul>


<h3>Radiotherapy</h3>

<ul>
<li>Early invasive breast cancer who have had breast conserving surgery with clear margins should have breast radiotherapy</li>
<li>Offer adjuvant radiotherapy to patients with DCIS following adequate breast conserving surgery</li>
<li>Offer adjuvant chest wall radiotherapy if mastectomy and are at a high risk of local recurrence</li>
<li>Do not offer radiotherapy following mastectomy to patients with early invasive breast cancer who are at low risk of local recurrence (for example, most patients who are lymph node-negative</li>
</ul>


<h3>Complications</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lymphodema: inform and give advice regarding avoidance of arm trauma</li>
<li>Arm Mobility: physio and functional exercises</li>
<li>Discontinue HRT if diagnosed with breast cancer</li>
</ul>
